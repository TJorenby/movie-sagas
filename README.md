# movie-sagas

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

This App is a movie library that allows users to browse titles, learn more about each title by clicking on the corresponding poster, and upload new titles to a database. 

In building this app, I practiced skills for full stack integration, connecting a React-powered front-end through a node server to a SQL database. This app features an emphasis on data routing using Junction tables and redux (sagas) as well as styling using React hooks, modals, and styled-components.  

This app features...
    - React
    - Node
    - Express
    - Redux
    - Postgres

Components were styled using...
    - SASS
    - React-Icons (Font Awesome)
    - Material UI
    - Styled Components

## Prerequisites 

To run this app, you will need:
    -Node.js
    -Postgres
    
## Install

To run this application:

    - Create a database using the provided .sql file
    - Run `npm install` from the project root directory
    - Run `npm run server` to run the node server
    - Run `npm run client` to launch the React app.
